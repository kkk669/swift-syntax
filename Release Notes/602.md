# Swift Syntax 602 Release Notes

## New APIs

## API Behavior Changes

## Deprecations

## API-Incompatible Changes

- `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToTrailingClosures` has changed to `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToLiteralClosures`
  - Description: Whether function-typed placeholders are expanded to trailing closures is now configurable using a `format` argument to this rewriter. Additionally clients that support nested placeholders may request that the entire expanded closure be wrapped in an outer placeholder, e.g. `<#{ <#foo#> in <#Bar#> }#>`.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2897
  - Migration steps: Replace uses of `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToTrailingClosures` with `ExpandEditorPlaceholdersToLiteralClosures`. The initializer does not need to change: `.init(indentationWidth:)` on the new type provides the same behavior as the old type.
  - Notes: This improves code completion in a SourceKitLSP session where the trailing closure form may be undesirable. The nested placeholders offer more flexibility to end users, in editors that support it.

- `SyntaxArena` and `ParsingSyntaxArena` has changed to SPI
  - Description: `SyntaxArena` and the subclasses were only meant to be used when dealing with `RawSyntax` which is also SPI.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2930
  - Migration steps: Do not use `SyntaxArena` or `ParsingSyntaxArena` directly.
  - Notes: Although the type itself was `public`, most initializers were already SPI and there was no way to retrive them from existing types via public API.

- `SyntaxChildrenIndex` is no longer `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`
  - Description: `nil` used to represent the end index. However, due to a change in the internal structure, the end index must now be retrieved from the collection.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2925
  - Migration steps: Use `SyntaxChildren.endIndex` instead.
  - Notes: `ExpressibleByNilLiteral` was a mistake. In general, `Collection.Index` should only be created and managed by the collection itself. For example, `Collection.index(after:)` exists, but `Index.advanced(by:)` does not.
